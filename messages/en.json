Commitments, excuses, impossible schedules.\n\nAnd in the end you stay home. Again. Watching on Instagram how others live what you wanted to live.\n\nIt has happened to me. More than once. And I got fed up.\n\nMany have said to me: \"Travel alone, it's a brutal experience\". I respect that. But it's not my style.\n\nI like to share the journey. Laugh in a group. Get lost with people who vibrate similarly. People I didn't know... and who end up being part of the trip beyond the destination.\n\nThat's why I'm creating Safar.\n\nA platform to organize trips and find compatible people to share them with.\n\nYou publish a plan. Or you join another one. Coordinate expenses, tasks, transportation. And you go.\n\nWithout headaches. Without relying on \"maybe I can\". Without staying home because you don't have company.\n\nAnd if you join the beta now, <highlight>the first 100 will get Premium features for life.</highlight>"
